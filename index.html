                Torrential rains have ravaged more than 72% of Pakistan. More than 1,100 people have lost their lives. Schools, crops, livestock, and homes have been destroyed, leaving women and their families in urgent need of temporary shelter and financial assistance. 
                In the wake of natural disasters, there is also an increased risk of violence against women. 
                UN Women is responding to the specific needs of displaced women and girls, including women with disabilities. Together with our partners we are providing immediate relief including shelter, food, medical aid, and sanitary products.
