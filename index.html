                Torrential rains have ravaged more than 72% of Pakistan. More than 1,100 people have lost their lives. Schools, crops, livestock, and homes have been destroyed, leaving women and their families in urgent need of temporary shelter and financial assistance. 
                In the wake of natural disasters, there is also an increased risk of violence against women. 
                UN Women is responding to the specific needs of displaced women and girls, including women with disabilities. Together with our partners we are providing immediate relief including shelter, food, medical aid, and sanitary products.

                Those who feel inclined to help larger communities are encouraged to donate money instead. You can donate money through reputable organisations such as the Salvation Army, Australian Red Cross, and Foodbank. Such organisations can easily pool funds for on-ground efforts and ensure that proper supplies and financial assistance go to those in need.

                        When putting together food baskets for the needy, you need to keep in mind that everything should be nonperishable.

Make sure that nonperishables aren't expired or about to expire -- and that the packaging is sealed. Purchase food with the full intention of putting it in the gift basket.
